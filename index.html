    <h1>Story Maps</h1>
    <blockquote>"Story mapping is a technique that provides the big picture that a pile of stories so often misses.
        [...] A big picture helps communicate effectively with users, it helps everyone involved avoid building
        unnecessary features, and it provides an orientation for a coherent user experience. [...] Stories are the
        building blocks of communication between developers and those who use their work. Story maps organize and
        structure these building blocks, and thus enhance this communication process â€” which is the most critical part
        of software development itself."
        <cite>Foreword by Martin Fowler</cite> in <cite>User Story Mapping</cite> by Jeff Patton

            <ol>
                <li>"I identify what rail safety data is relevant to my work."
                    <ol>
                        <li>Identify zone of operation for each inspector.</li>
                        <li>Identify relevant timeframe.</li>
                        <li>Identify data set meeting above criteria.</li>
                        <li>Identify relevant data in that data set.</li>

                <li>"I request the report."
                    <ol>
                        <li>Upload report to the website.</li>
                        <li>Link to it on the Reports page.</li>
                        <li>Ensure inspectors know where to find it.</li>

    <h2>What are Story Maps?</h2>
    <p>User story maps are a visualization of goals, steps, and tasks as squares with text arranged in a grid. In the first row, and first column, is a square which describes an activity a person wants to complete. In the second row, a square is placed for each step the person will take in order to complete the activity. Then a horizontal line is drawn beneath the second row. Each row beneath this line will contain tasks to be performed by the team that enable the person to perform the step above the line.</p>

    <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Create Shared Understanding</strong><br />
            Story maps give teams a shared understanding of the desired outcomes of the work.</li>
        <li><strong>Prioritize Tasks</strong><br />
            Story maps help teams consider the value they deliver to people when prioritizing tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Scope Tasks</strong><br />
            Story maps help a team align the scope of their individual tasks with the desired outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Discover Opportunities</strong><br />
            Story maps reveal opportunities to deliver more value to people while doing less work.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexible Planning</strong><br />
            Story maps provide acceptance criteria alongside tasks, making it easier to change either as a team.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Use Cases</h2>
    <p>If any of the following situations are true for a particular team, project, or goal, then story maps may be a
        good fit.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The project is used by or directly impacts a large number of people in different ways, and the success of
            the project depends on how well you understand the needs of those people.</li>
        <li>Cross-functional teams collaborate on the project and would benefit from having a shared understanding of
            the desired outcomes of the work.</li>
        <li>The project has many tasks that are able to be delivered separately, and the team would benefit from having
            a way to prioritize those tasks based on the value they deliver to people.</li>
        <li>It is unclear when a task is considered complete without understanding the desired outcomes.</li>
        <li>The team is unsure how to break down a large project into smaller, more manageable pieces.</li>
        <li>The cost or risk of spending time doing the wrong work is high.</li>
        <li>When the right solution will likely come from collaboration between people with varying expertise.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>When creating a story map talking things over as a team from the start, you may find it helpful to discuss it in steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Frame the problem: who is it for and why are we building it?</li>
        <li>Map the big picture: breadth, not depth; mile wide, inch deep</li>
        <li>Explore: talk about the people and what might go wrong, joys, pains</li>
        <li>Slice out a release strategy: focus on the people you're serving and plan the order of features by impact on business goals</li>
        <li>Slice out a learning strategy: what features to implement or pilot with users earlier to confirm assumptions before building upon them</li>
        <li>Slice out a development strategy: what to build earlier which may require experimentation, and what to build later; plan what technical challenges need to be determined and resolved sooner rather than later</li>
    </ol>
