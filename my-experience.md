## Uber for Package Delivery

Years ago, a friend approached me with an idea for a startup. He wanted to build an app that would connect people who needed to send packages with people who were already traveling to the destination. The idea was that the traveler would deliver the package for a fee, and the sender would save time and money over traditional shipping methods.

I didn't know what to make of the idea at first, so we met to talk it over. We considered:

1. The people who would use the app to send packages, and why they would want to use it.
2. The people who would deliver the packages, and their motivations for doing so.
3. The people who would receive the packages.
4. The risks involved in the process.

We stopped there. Concerns about liability, theft, and fraud were too great to overcome. We decided to abandon the idea.

We used stories to avoid building the wrong thing.
