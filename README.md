# User Story Mapping

## Background

User stories as a concept is part of the Agile software development methodology, while Kent Beck originated the notion of a "story" in 2001.

"Story mapping is a technique that provides the big picture that a pile of stories so often misses. [...] A big picture helps communicate effectively with users, it helps everyone involved avoid building unnecessary features, and it provides an orientation for a coherent user experience. [...] Stories are the building blocks of communication between developers and those who use their work. Story maps organize and structure these building blocks, and thus enhance this communication process — which is the most critical part of software development itself." - Martin Fowler, foreword in "User Story Mapping" by Jeff Patton

## Benefits of Story Mapping for Teams

- **Create a Shared Understanding**
  Story maps give teams a shared understanding of the desired outcomes of the work.  
- **Help Prioritize Tasks**
  Story maps help teams consider the value they deliver to people when prioritizing tasks.  
- **Help Scope Tasks**
  Story maps help a team align the scope of their individual tasks with the desired outcomes.  
- **Reveal Opportunities**
  Story maps reveal opportunities to deliver more value to people while doing less work.  

## When Story Maps Should Be Considered

If any of the following situations are true for a particular team, project, or task, then story maps may be a good fit.

1. The project is used by or directly impacts a large number of people in different ways, and the success of the project depends on how well you understand the needs of those people.
2. Cross-functional teams collaborate on the project and would benefit from having a shared understanding of the desired outcomes of the work.
3. The project has many tasks that are able to be delivered separately, and the team would benefit from having a way to prioritize those tasks based on the value they deliver to people.
4. It is unclear when a task is considered complete without understanding the desired outcomes.
5. The team is unsure how to break down a large project into smaller, more manageable pieces.
6. The risk of spending time doing the wrong work is high.

## How to Create a Story Map

"A common way to use stories is to build a list of them, prioritize them, and begin talking about them and then turning them into software one at a time." - Jeff Patton, "User Story Mapping"

"Gary and I started talking. And as he talked, I wrote cards with key points from what he said. There’s a mantra that I like when I build story maps. I’ll say “talk and doc” (short for the verb document), which basically means don’t let your words vaporize." - Jeff Patton, "User Story Mapping"

"When working with a team to build a story map, or having discussions about anything, create a simple visualization to support your discussion." - Jeff Patton, "User Story Mapping"
