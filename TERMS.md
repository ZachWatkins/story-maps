# Terms for the Story Map process.

1. Story Map
   Description: User story mapping puts the focus on the user, ensuring that the backlog contains stories that add real value to the customer by helping them achieve their goals. Plus, story mapping allows your team to plan and order their work so that it delivers the highest value to customers first.  
2. Journey Map
   Description: Journey mapping is a UX tool that helps teams visualize the journey a customer needs to take so they can accomplish a goal. Journey maps focus on the journey for a single persona or customer, based on the persona’s specific scenario and expectations. This is useful for aligning the team, getting them focused on the user experience, and basing decisions. Unlike user story mapping, it’s focused on the user experience and the vision for the product.  
3. Event Storming
   Description: Event storming involves running a workshop with key business stakeholders present. The attendees write down business events (things that happen), commands (things that trigger the events), and reactions (things that happen as a result) on sticky notes. These notes are organized sequentially to map out the business processes. Unlike user story mapping, which is focused on refining the backlog to deliver a working product for the user, event storming is more high-level and done early in the product planning process.  
3. User
4. Persona
5. Output
   Description: Output is the name for everything done between the idea for work and the delivery of that work.
6. Outcome
   Description: Outcome is the name for the change in human behavior that results from the output.
